## 🧩 Projects

### 🪐 **FPGA Logic Optimization Framework**
Optimized FPGA logic synthesis for open-source toolchain **SymbiFlow**, reducing synthesis time by **15%**.  
Enhanced automated test coverage by **30%** using custom Python verification scripts and continuous integration testing.  
> _Built around the same performance and reliability principles Core OS engineers apply to Apple silicon bring-up._

---

### ⚡ **Embedded Phone-Lock System**
Developed an ESP32-based phone lock interface with **IMU sensor, uLCD, and capacitive keypad**.  
Implemented FreeRTOS threads for real-time motion detection, display updates, and authentication.  
> _Mirrors Core OS real-time task management and thread synchronization concepts._

---

### 🔧 **System Performance Profiler**
Created a lightweight profiling tool to monitor CPU cycles and task latency on microcontrollers.  
Used **C/C++** and **hardware timers** to log context-switch times and optimize scheduler parameters.  
> _Demonstrates understanding of system scheduling, timing, and low-level performance tuning._
